# Malthusian-trap
Simulation of Malthusian growth with steady-state upper limit and consumption booms.

v1: Takes initial population and upper limit as exogenous, and plots
the log of the population.

v3: Made population explicitly depend on c. Made c explicitly depend on L and N.
Now N and c co-depend and move together.

The function is a generalized sigmoid.

Just run the file. Play around with the variables. In future, some inputs
will be endogenously decided: Upper limit as a function of income per capita,
income per capita as a function of land, etc. And some different kinds of noise
to approximate other things.
