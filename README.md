# Malthusian-trap
Simulation of Malthusian growth with steady-state upper limit and consumption booms.

v1: Takes initial population and upper limit as exogenous, and plots
the log of the population.

v3: Made population explicitly depend on c. Made c explicitly depend on L and N.
Now N and c co-depend and move together.


Just run the file. Play around with the variables.
